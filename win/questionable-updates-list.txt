Notice: This is not a complete listing of potentially unwanted Windows 7 SP1 Home Premium updates with respect to undesired Windows 10 upgrade.
Even after hiding updates, Microsoft will re-issue and unhide updates: http://www.infoworld.com/article/2922604/microsoft-windows/microsoft-re-re-re-issues-controversial-windows-10-advertising-patch-kb-3035583.html
In the past, Microsoft has used Windows Update to silently install updates without any way of the user knowing [citation needed]. This capability can be abused to force any update despite Windows 10 not being installed.
Some updates may include other fixes that might be beneficial to your system. Notable (read: not all) ones are marked with (?).

Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB3050265)

Update type: Optional

More information: 
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3050265

Reason:
" * General improvements are made to support upgrades to a later version of Windows."
" * This update installs a new Group Policy object that enables you to block upgrades to the latest version of Windows through Windows Update."
Alternative to the Group Policy object is a registry entry. Even with this entry, I still face attempts to make me download the GWX app.
